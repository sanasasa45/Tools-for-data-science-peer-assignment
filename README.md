# Data Science Tools and Ecosystem


<div class= "alert alert-block alert-warning">
     <b>In this notebook, Data Science Tools and Ecosystem are summarized.     
Some important data science tools are:
1. SAS
2. Apache Spark
3. BigML BigML
4. D3.js 
5. MatLab        
The term data ecosystem refers to the programming languages, packages, algorithms, cloud-computing services, and general infrastructure an organization uses to collect, store, analyze, and leverage data.No two organizations leverage the same data in the same way. As such, each organization has a unique data ecosystem. These ecosystems may overlap in some cases, particularly when data is pulled or scraped from a public source, or when third-party providers are leveraged (for example, cloud storage providers).</b>

### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python
Addition
$$
a+b
$$
Subtraction
$$
a-b
$$
Multiplication
$$
a \cdot b
$$



# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers
a = (3*4)+5
print(a)



total_minutes = 200
hours = total_minutes // 60
time_string = "{}:{}".format(total_minutes, hours)
print(time_string)



**Objectives:**
List popular languages for Data Science
<ul>
<li> Python</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>R</li>
</ul>
